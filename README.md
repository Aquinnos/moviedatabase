## About the Application

This application is a movie database that allows users to search for and view information about various movies. It is built using the following technologies:

- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Fetch API**: The application uses the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the external movie API. This allows the application to retrieve movie data dynamically based on user input.

## Features

- **Search Movies**: Users can search for movies by title.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about each movie, including the cast, plot, and ratings.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works on all devices.

## How It Works

1. **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a movie title in the search bar, and the application will fetch data from an external movie API.
2. **Display Results**: The search results are displayed in a list format, showing the movie title, release year, and a brief description.
